FONTLOG for the lilyjazz-chord font
===================================

This file provides detailed information on the lilyjazz-chord font software. This information should be distributed along with the lilyjazz-chord font and any derivative works.


Basic font information
----------------------
lilyjazz-chord is a typeface designed by Jean-Pierre G., specifically to make chords easier to write in LilyPond. Generally a regular text font, there are a few custom glyph code points pertaining to chords that supersede the normal characters:

- "<" : the flat symbol
- ">" : the sharp symbol
- "^" : the "major" triangle symbol
- "0" : the "diminished" circle symbol
- "@" : the "half-diminished" slashed-circle symbol
- "[" : a thinner left parenthesis for stacked number chords
- "]" : a thinner right parenthesis for stacked number chords

On 28 July, 2014, Jean-Pierre corresponded with Abraham Lee:

    The font is free for use and distribution.
    You can use it as you want.
    I never plan to work more on that so you can upgrade it.

From at day on, Abraham Lee has become the current designer and maintainer for the forseeable future. This font software is not designed for use in a word-processing application, although all the glyphs may be accessed at their respective Unicode points. It was originally designed for use with LilyPond, the automatic music engraver.
