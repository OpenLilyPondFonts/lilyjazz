FONTLOG for the lilyjazz-text font
==================================

This file provides detailed information on the lilyjazz-text font software. This information should be distributed along with the lilyjazz-text fonts and any derivative works.


Basic font information
----------------------
lilyjazz-text is a typeface designed by Torsten Hämmerle to resemble a hand-written text font more suitable to jazz-like hand-written scores. Since Torsten is no longer available to publicly maintain lilyjazz-text, Abraham Lee has become the current designer and maintainer for the forseeable future. This font software is not designed for use in a word-processing application, although all the glyphs may be accessed at their respective Unicode points. It was originally designed for use with LilyPond, the automatic music engraver.
