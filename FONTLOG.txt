FONTLOG for the LilyJAZZ font
=============================

This file provides detailed information on the LilyJAZZ font software. This information should be distributed along with the LilyJAZZ fonts and any derivative works.


Basic font information
----------------------
LilyJAZZ is a typeface designed by Torsten Hämmerle to resemble a hand-written font more suitable to jazz-like hand-written scores. Since Torsten is no longer available to publicly maintain LilyJAZZ, Abraham Lee has become the current designer and maintainer for the forseeable future. This font software is not designed for use in a word-processing application, although all the glyphs may be accessed at their respective Unicode points. It was originally designed for use with LilyPond, the automatic music engraver.
