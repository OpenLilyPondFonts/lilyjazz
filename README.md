LilyJAZZ Font Family
====================

To make the most of these fonts, there are two text fonts that should be 
installed in the operating system's normal font installation location 
(which is different for each OS):

- **lilyjazz-text**: A hand-written font that is common for jazz text objects. 
  This is the default text font in the ``lilyjazz.ily`` stylesheet.
- **lilyjazz-chord**: Another hand-written font that is more calm with some
  convenience characters for typesetting sharps, flats, etc. This font is
  used in the ``jazzchords.ily`` stylesheet.
